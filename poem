            <p>It’s not an earth shattering realisation<br>
                Seeing you move across the room,<br>
                Saying hi to your friends<br>
                That were also my friends,<br>
                That somehow became ours<br>
                Before either of us noticed.</p>

            <p>It’s not an earth shattering feeling<br>
                This love I have for you<br>
                That grew in small, ordinary moments<br>
                Like the day I sat with you to study,<br>
                Me escaping my own responsibilities<br>
                Just to be next to you.<br>
                We barely spoke,<br>
                But the silence felt warm,<br>
                Steady,<br>
                Comforting in a way I didn’t expect.<br>
                Just being near you<br>
                Was its own kind of peace.</p>

            <p>It’s not an earth shattering thing<br>
                How the quiet with you<br>
                Never feels empty.<br>
                It’s soft and full,<br>
                Like a space that holds us gently.<br>
                Your hand fits perfectly in mine,<br>
                And<br>
                And<br>
                In every small moment with you<br>
                I find myself wanting more<br>
                More days, more pages,<br>
                More chapters with you beside me.</p>

            <p>It’s not an earth shattering realisation<br>
                That I want forever and more with you.<br>
                It feels natural, inevitable —<br>
                Like choosing you is the easiest thing<br>
                My heart has ever done.</p>

            <p>Happy Birthday, Love.<br>
                Thank you for being here.</p>
